# DeGruchy.org

This is my new static, [IndieWeb][iw]-ified landing page for everything
else in my life. I've collected as much as was important and wired it
up. If you feel like I'm missing something, then feel free to either
[email][em] me, file a [bug report][bugs] or contact the [mailing
list][ml] regarding the issue.

If you're seeing this on GitHub, then know that this is just a
downstream copy to use GitHub Pages. The real, upstream, source is
[located on my SourceHut][sh].
