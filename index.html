<!--
	Hello!

	I hope you like the site. If you're reading this, then you're
	likely someone who wants to know how all this *works*, or already
	does and just want to "peek under the hood". That's
	good. Generally, my ideal website works like this:

		- Uses as few external resources as possible
		- Fonts from the system by being as generic as possible
		- Let the browser handle things. Don't try to reimpose order
		  where it already exists.
		- Don't care about old browsers (insofar as shimming features,
		  or adding markup)
		- HTML, CSS and only if unimplementable without it, JavaScript
		- Modern image formats, where appropriate
		- Reduce "classitis" as it just adds markup bloat
		- Eliminate "divitis"
		- Be as DRY as possible
		- Yes, long selectors are "slower", but I also don't have to
		  rely on hundreds of classes
		- Law of least surprise. Things should function as the user
		  expects them to

	As an informal set of "rules", they're also meant to be broken
	where appropriate. You do your best, care enough about the user
	and don't waste cycles on trying to do everything. HTML is a text
	format, it should degrade nicely.  If it doesn't, you're doing it
	wrong.

		# Litany Against Fear

		I must not fear.
		Fear is the mind-killer.
		Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
		I will face my fear.
		I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
		And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
		Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
		Only I will remain. -->

				Yes, that about does it. I'm kind of an interesting guy in my estimation. I do work that requires me to be a "jack-of-all-trades" kind of tech and while I don't normally learn everything well enough to be good at it, some stuff does eventually sink in.
