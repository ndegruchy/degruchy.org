		<!-- # Litany Against Fear
			 
			 I must not fear.  
			 Fear is the mind-killer.  
			 Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.  
			 I will face my fear.  
			 I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  
			 And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  
			 Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.	 
			 Only I will remain. -->

				<p>
					Yes, that about does it. I'm kind of an
					interesting guy in my estimation.  I do work that
					requires me to be a "jack-of-all-trades" kind of
					tech and while I don't normally learn everything
					well enough to be good at it, some stuff does
					eventually sink in.

					Here's where I have information and links to my
					various profiles on other systems. I try to keep
					these to a minimum, or at least use ones that
					aren't data-mining silos.
				</p>
				<h3>Coding Forges</h3>
				<p>
					My primary coding forge of my personal Gitea
					instance, but I do have a GitHub account. It's
					kind of unavoidable.</p>
				<ul>
                    <li><a href="https://git.degruchy.org/nathan" rel="me">My Repositories</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/ndegruchy/" rel="me">GitHub</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Photos</h3>
				<p>
					Mostly I <a
					href="https://www.flickr.com/people/nathandegruchy"
					rel="me">post pictures to Flickr</a> in private
					sets. There are, however, some public images
					available. Additionally, there are other sites
					that collect photos I take (of one kind or
					another):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/nathandegruchy" rel="me">Flickr</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/3345587">iNaturalist</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Misc.</h3>
				<p>
					These are sites that don't really fit a large
					enough category to justify listing them
					individually:
				</p>
				<ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ndegruchy" rel="me">Wikipedia Page</a></li>
					<li id="wishlist"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/234TT2G75J5OE?ref_=wl_share">Wishlist</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://liberapay.com/ndegruchy/">LibrePay</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://bandcamp.com/nathandegruchy">Bandcamp</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://ndegruchy.itch.io/" rel="me">Itch.io</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can also find me on
					<code>irc.freenode.net</code> as
					<code>ndegruchy</code>.

	                Where <em>Not</em> to Find Me

					I generally avoid things like closed social silos,
					like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
					<em>anywhere</em> on Google et al. Though,
					strangely, I still have a LinkedIn account&hellip;
				</p>
                <p>
					You also won't find a RSS/ATOM/JSON feed of my
					work anymore. I'm done with it, if you want to
					hear my opinions or thoughts, ask me. Otherwise,
					I'm done maintaining <a href="/blog/">my void
                    shouty machine</a>.

				Colophon

				Made in an afternoon, in Emacs with at least two cups

				<small>Apparently, "colophon" is some maker text
				usually at the bottom of a paper or end of a
